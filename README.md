Last year I was introduced to turicreate, it seemed fast and fairly easy to use.
I took a course on ML with graphlab and that proved to be worthwhile. It works very well with the SSD as it has scalable frames.

## The most interesting thing that I found in the turicreate:
1. Groupby statements
2. Loading SFrames and models
3. Join statements
4. Flat map - Map each row of the SFrame to multiple rows in a new SFrame via a function.
